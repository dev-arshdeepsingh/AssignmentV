      Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark[10] was a billionaire industrialist, a
      founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A
      brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius,
      billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and
      exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most
      powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy
      lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in
      Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his
      life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape
      his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use
      against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark.
      Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron
      Man. Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found
      himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor poisoning his body, all while he
      was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his legacy. After
      the Stark Expo incident, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant
      for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology
      while he began a relationship with Pepper Potts. With the world yet again
      being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri
      and Loki. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress
      disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and
      help him retire. The 2013 "Mandarin" terrorist attacks forced Stark to
      come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his
      loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was
      destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the
      mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, and was
      prompted to destroy all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol after
      almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially
      demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more armors and resumed
      his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of Baron Strucker and
      acquiring Loki's Scepter. Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at
      last, Stark, influenced by Scarlet Witch's visions, built Ultron with the
      help of Bruce Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and
      allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity
      threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to
      extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was
      defeated, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being
      lost during which Sokovia was elevated into the sky. After the Ultron
      Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in
      the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so
      much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support
      the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally
      Captain America when the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter
      Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The result left the Avengers in
      complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier's
      role in his parents' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to
      mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a better hero than he ever was,
      also becoming engaged with Potts in the process. In 2018, when Thanos and
      the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six
      Infinity Stones, Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle
      Thanos on Titan with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When Stark
      was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the Time Stone for
      Stark's life. After the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole survivors
      on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape Titan, but were
      stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by Captain
      Marvel, who brought them back to Earth. In the five years after the Snap,
      Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a
      daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method to safely travel through
      time and space, he rejoined the Avengers in their mission to acquire the
      six Infinity Stones from the past in order to resurrect those killed by
      the Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter and regain the
      Tesseract. During the Battle of Earth, Stark sacrificed himself to
      eliminate an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who traveled
      through time to collect their Infinity Stones, saving the universe from
      decimation and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered
      superheroes.

      <h2 style="color: white">Thor:</h2>
      Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of both
      Asgard and New Asgard, a founding member of the Avengers, and a former
      member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When his irresponsible and
      impetuous behavior reignited an ancient war between Asgard and Jotunheim,
      Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power and hammer
      Mjølnir, he was banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor
      found love with Jane Foster, and learned humility by saving his new
      friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of
      sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his
      power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.
      Upon being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor was forced to return to
      Earth in order to retrieve Loki after he had begun his attempt at world
      domination with the Tesseract. Thor joined the Avengers under the guidance
      of S.H.I.E.L.D. and stood with them to stop Loki's schemes, eventually
      following the newly formed team as they battled against Loki's Chitauri
      army during the Battle of New York. After Loki's defeat, Thor captured and
      returned him to Asgard to await justice for his crimes. Thor helped the
      Asgardian armies restore peace across all of the Nine Realms during the
      War of the Nine Realms. However, the peace was disrupted by Malekith and
      the Dark Elves, who wanted to use the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms
      into eternal darkness. When Foster absorbed the Aether, Thor rallied to
      protect her on Asgard, leading to an attack by Malekith which resulted in
      Frigga's death. When the Aether was eventually removed from Foster, Thor
      helped defeat Malekith and his forces before they could unleash the Aether
      during the Convergence. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left
      Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster. During their time together,
      Thor enchanted Mjølnir to protect Foster. During his stay on Earth, Thor
      helped the Avengers to locate Loki's Scepter during the fight against
      HYDRA. Following HYDRA's defeat and the capture of Baron Strucker, the
      team had to stop the newly created Ultron, a rogue A.I. created by Tony
      Stark which conspired to bring about human extinction. Once Ultron had
      been defeated, Thor went back to Asgard to investigate the visions he saw
      when being manipulated by Wanda Maximoff of the Infinity Stones. In his
      investigations, Thor also discovered that Loki was still alive and had
      usurped Odin's royal throne during Thor's absence. To aid in both pursuing
      his brother and finding his father to return peace to Asgard, Thor sought
      help from Doctor Strange, who led him to Odin moments before his passing
      to Valhalla. Shortly afterwards, Thor met Hela, the Goddess of Death and
      his half-sister. In the wake of his first encounter with Hela, Mjølnir was
      destroyed, and he was stranded in Sakaar, where he was forced to compete
      in the Contest of Champions. After a reunion and subsequent fight with
      Hulk, the pair allied with the rogue Valkyrie in order to save Asgard and
      escape Sakaar. After battling with Hela and losing an eye to her, Thor
      then had Loki unleash Ragnarök and destroy Asgard, killing Hela in the
      process, although he escaped with the remaining Asgardians. Declaring that
      Asgard was all its people and not a place, Thor accepted his newfound
      position as king and decided to relocate the Asgardians on Earth. As they
      were en route to Earth, their ship was attacked by Thanos and the Black
      Order, who took the Tesseract and murdered his brother, before leaving
      Thor for dead. He was rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy and had
      teamed up with Rocket Raccoon and Groot to travel to Nidavellir. With the
      help of Eitri, Thor crafted Stormbreaker and aided the nation of Wakanda
      and the Avengers in confronting Thanos and his forces. However, Thor
      squandered his chance to kill Thanos with his new weapon and Thanos
      activated the completed Infinity Gauntlet and erased half the universe's
      population from existence. After the Avengers were joined by Captain
      Marvel, the team traveled to the Garden, where Thor and the Avengers
      ambushed Thanos, discovering that the Titan destroyed the Stones, ensuring
      that a reversal of his actions was now impossible. Enraged, Thor beheaded
      Thanos using Stormbreaker and left the planet. Following Thanos' death,
      Thor left the Avengers and relocated to Tønsberg, Norway, where he and the
      surviving Asgardians resettled, establishing New Asgard. Five years later,
      Hulk and Rocket convinced the now-overweight and depressed Thor to rejoin
      the team after discovering how to travel through time. Thor joined the
      Avengers on their Time Heist and the ensuing battle against an alternate
      Thanos alongside Captain America and Iron Man, ending in Stark sacrificing
      his life to destroy Thanos' forces. After attending Stark's funeral, Thor
      decided to join the Guardians of the Galaxy, proclaiming Valkyrie to
      succeed him as king of the Asgardians. For the next two years, Thor
      journeyed with the Guardians, but his time with them was brought to an end
      in 2025 due to Gorr's vow against the gods. During a battle against Gorr,
      Thor would be joined by his former flame, Jane Foster, who to Thor's
      surprise now wielded Mjølnir. Thor, joined by Korg, Valkyrie and Foster
      went on a mission to warn the other gods and get an army to fight Gorr,
      Thor and his team traveled to Omnipotence City to warn Zeus. The
      disagreement of the Olympians led to confrontation, in which then Thor
      heavily injured Zeus. Eventually, Thor alongside Foster managed to defeat
      Gorr but at the cost of her life. After Gorr died, Thor adopted his
      daughter and trained her, with the duo becoming known as Love and Thunder,
      who set off upon adventures as protectors of other aliens across the
      universe.

      <h2 style="color: white">Spiderman:</h2>
      Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko,
      he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August
      1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic
      books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.
      Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter
      was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by his
      Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
      Parker died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko and later creators had the
      character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and
      gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah
      Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane
      Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green
      Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman
      spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.
      These powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina,
      durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings
      like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
      "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot
      artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting
      and for web-swinging across the city. Peter Parker originally used his
      powers for his own personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a
      thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to fight crime
      by becoming Spider-Man. When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s,
      teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of
      sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by
      featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as
      Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
      inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
      relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous
      teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor
      like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself
      that "with great power comes great responsibility"—a line included in a
      text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story, but
      later retroactively attributed to the late Uncle Ben Parker. Marvel has
      featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and
      longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Since his
      introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high
      school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his
      late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most
      notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the
      identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in
      which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has also published comic books
      featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099,
      which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the
      future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenage
      Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man,
      which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of
      Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later
      became a superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream
      continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he sometimes works
      alongside the mainline version of Peter. Spider-Man is one of the most
      popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] He has appeared in
      countless forms of media, including several animated TV series: the first
      original animated series Spider-Man, with Paul Soles voicing the titular
      character, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic
      strips, and multiple series of films. Spider-Man was first portrayed in
      live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a recurring skit on
      The Electric Company from 1974 to 1977.[11] In live-action films,
      Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi's
      Spider-Man trilogy, by Andrew Garfield in two films directed by Marc
      Webb,[12] and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve
      Carney originally starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical
      Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[13] Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake
      Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the
      Spider-Verse, with the former reprising his role in the sequel,
      Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Publication history Further
      information: List of Spider-Man titles Creation and development A black
      and white picture of a man standing in front of a spider web. Richard
      Wentworth, a.k.a. the Spider in the pulp magazine The Spider. Stan Lee
      stated the Spider influenced the creation of Spider-Man.[14] In 1962, with
      the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer
      Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for
      Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the
      desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]: 1  As
      with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of
      his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.[16] In his
      autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter
      the Spider as a great influence,[14]: 130 [17] and in a multitude of print
      and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb
      up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often
      he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Besides the
      name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld (a
      defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through years of
      ceaseless struggle developed a "sixth sense", which warns him of danger,
      the inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense".[17] Although at the time
      teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says
      he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series
      progressed, and felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character
      sound inferior to other superheroes.[18] He also decided to insert a
      hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another
      superhero with a red and blue costume that starts with an "S" and ends
      with "man"[19] (although artist Steve Ditko intended the character to have
      an orange and purple costume).[20] At that time, Lee had to get only the
      consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval.
      In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome
      Goodman's objections.[note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man
      tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the
      final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series
      Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for issue #15
      (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).[21] In particular, Lee
      stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy
      would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him
      to use Spider-Man.[18] While this was the final issue, its editorial page
      anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spider-Man ... will appear
      every month in Amazing."
